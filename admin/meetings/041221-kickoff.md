# 041221 Kickoff meeting Group 5

- Held on Zoom

Things to address:
1. Choose group theme/name
2. Roles in the group
3. Expectations of the group
4. Stuff for the group MD page (Style, introduction paragraphs, pictures)
5. Group contract (everyone needs to sign)
6. Ask about values important to the team then document them for the page later
7. Can build MD page later, just need group members to submit introduction, or if they want can reuse previous introduction they submitted in the slack channel
8. Can make group video out of previous introductions, or maybe do another introduction video so we all can make it professional?

Review of Group Contract that we have so far and suggestions on it:
- Everyone agrees with what we have so far
- Allow for questions if people are confused at any point

Group page:
- Everyone submits their own introduction
- Can pull from the existing repo
- Watch out for merge conflicts
- Set style and that way everyone can kind of personalize their own section

Group video:
- Everyone submits their own mp4 file
- Set of questions for introductions
- 20 seconds per person
- Compile them all together to make finished product

- Make a folder called images for people to upload headshots
- Make an announcement for lists of small tasks for group members to do

Questions about the project:
- Is there a required set of roles or do we determine them?

Weekly meetings around same time at 1:00 P.M.

Jessi will post designs tonight with the logo and let us vote on which one we like the most

Ended: 1:31 P.M.
