# Notes:
- Free-flowing, each person has their own sticky note section but can add stuff on as they see fit
- Compilation of general ideas that we share
- Examples of other bullet journals, case studies and other notes about bullet journals
- Make fat marker sketch and wireframe

# Design Decisions:
- Overall simple design, allow a little customization: Fonts, images, but maintain the simplicity, smaller areas of personalization rather than complete overhaul
- small things: change color of webpage, different theme modes that don't change layout, only small things like colors
- Special patterns for each kind of note, helps with accessibility and also gives us a special flair to the webpage
- Allow for lots of contrast (black text on white background), colorblind color pallettes so we don't mix colors that clash, navigation options too
- Keyboard shortcuts/ less reliance on mouse
- Both local and cloud storage: google drive, etc. First work with local, then go to cloud
- Allow for filtering based on labels or category (task, event, etc.), add a selection bar at the top to filter by certain topic
- Simple organization, have a sidebar to allow for searching months, allows you to easily jump to the part of the page where a certain month is
- Want to maintain a simple design so users don't get lost and it doesn't lose the purpose of what it's supposed to be in the end: bullet journal
- Limitation on bullet "title", can add a description if necessary if they really want to elaborate on something
- "Description" can include other larger forms of information as well (pictures, video, audio)
- Allow for export if the person chooses, different formats such as docx, pdf, but also have google drive integration later so it can just backup to the google drive
