# Statement of Purpose
## Ideas for Statement of Purpose
- Keeping track of different activities, need categories to prevent getting projects mixed up

- Underlying Problems for our Users:
  - **Needs simplicity to save time**
  - Needs consistency, deal with prioritizing/organizing
  - Wants more time
  - People are afraid of their todo list being watched/used nefariously, **ensure privacy**
  - People want to look back on their work, too
  - People have times where they are more productive, want to be reminded then
  - Overplanning, taking too much tasks
  - typing/visual accesibility issues (e.g. slow typing, small letters)
  - people forget to look at their lists, lose track of tasks
  - not knowing how to use a task list
  
- What we will do to solve the problems:
  - (1) **Make an app that is simple, intuitive, easy to use, easy to view, easy to access, not cognitively demanding, doesn't add to your stress/workload but instead takes away from it, fast to use**
  - Easy to view multiple things at once and narrow down options (design problem)
  - (2) Have features that allow people to categorize their activities/planning into different areas/projects so they can be productiven their multifaceted lives. Have ways of grouping tasks
  - (3) **Have simple ways to view your progress/growth in life, e.g. timeline view, categories, recent events, etc.**
  - Let people schedule reminders, maybe even reminders based on activity tracking (post-workout, after sleep, etc.)
  - Provide functionality that helps people manage hwo long each task will take to prevent overplanning
  - (4) voice-to-text to help accesibility, font size adjustment for accesibility, color theme adjust for accesbility
  - (5) Give reminders to prevent people losing track of their planning/execution habits, make something that helps people **build habits** that amount to productivity (gamify task completion, viz to make completing tasks more fun)
  - Provide educational resource to help people get started on a new productivity habit (e.g. us a link to some place that already does this)
  - short-trem vs mid-term vs. long-term task categorization
- 
- Impact we will attempt to have:
  - Give people more time
  - Help them meet career and family goals
  -
