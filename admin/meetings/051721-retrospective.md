# Sprint Retrospective

# What went well this sprint?

- Got a lot of logistical stuff done so we know what to do for further sprints, have an actual product to look at 
- finished basic functionality such as entries into journal
- were able to get to work very quickly and make a good foundation with all 7 group members at once
- have most of the CI/CD pipeline finished, able to automate some of the stuff we need to do

# What could have gone better?

- Faster about making the CI/CD pipeline
- Finished a bit more by dividing up tasks better, structured more issues etc.
- Taking a while to get TA approval for project

# What will we try next instead?

- Check-in more often with the group, keep updates on progress so we can see where everyone is (daily async: message in slack)
- Utilize the issues system in github so we can divide the tasks more effectively
- utilize CI/CD pipeline now that we have it built

# What questions do we have?

- How will we perform testing?: Use small JSON file for testing indexedDB/Dexie (Jest), manual testing & inspection of elements 
- How will we structure standups?: Everybody each day sends a message about what they did today, around 6 P.M. (doesn't always have to have something, perfectly fine to have days where you aren't able to do anything)
- Pair Programming for labs or project?: Make a slack channel, tasks that have overlap have people pair up, pair up for labs too if able to (slack channel)

# Thank you everyone for your hard work this sprint!
