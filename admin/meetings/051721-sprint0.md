# Sprint Review

- Decided on framework/apis/etc for the build pipeline
- Initial foundation for BuJo
- tabs, entry creation, page title, highlights hovering over tab, tag dropdown, new entry text box

# Sprint Retrospective

# What went well this sprint?

- Got a lot of logistical stuff done so we know what to do for further sprints, have an actual product to look at 
- finished basic functionality such as entries into journal
- were able to get to work very quickly and make a good foundation with all 7 group members at once
- have most of the CI/CD pipeline finished, able to automate some of the stuff we need to do

# What could have gone better?

- Faster about making the CI/CD pipeline
- Finished a bit more by dividing up tasks better, structured more issues etc.
- Taking a while to get TA approval for project

# What will we try next instead?

- Check-in more often with the group, keep updates on progress so we can see where everyone is (daily async: message in slack)
- Utilize the issues system in github so we can divide the tasks more effectively
- utilize CI/CD pipeline now that we have it built

# What questions do we have?

- How will we perform testing?: Use small JSON file for testing indexedDB/Dexie (Jest), manual testing & inspection of elements 
- How will we structure standups?: Everybody each day sends a message about what they did today, around 6 P.M. (doesn't always have to have something, perfectly fine to have days where you aren't able to do anything)
- Pair Programming for labs or project?: Make a slack channel, tasks that have overlap have people pair up, pair up for labs too if able to (slack channel)

# Thank you everyone for your hard work this sprint!

-----------------------------------
# Sprint Planning

# Sprint Goal

Add more functionality, try and finish a prototype by end of week.

# Review Roadmap

- What we have so far
    - Decided on framework/apis/etc for build pipeline
    - Initial foundations for BuJo UI, (show in video)
     - tabs 
     - page title
     - highlights when hovering over tabs, selecting
     - tag selector
     - new entry button with text entry box

# Groom backlog and review/update stories

- Pipeline still being built/ 50% functionality
    - have frameworks/APIs selected for build pipeline
    - have weekly routine of mob coding on Mondays
    - add issues/fix issue in branch/pull request on individual time

# Review progress for the week and discuss

[Go over everyone's progress for the week and document it, use that as indicators for how much work to be done for the next meeting.]
- Nico: Helped with mob coding, Made CI/CD Diagram
- Matthew: Researched StandardJS and helped group to learn about it
- Jessi: N/A
- Aasem: Helped with mob coding, made branch for entry box, and researched documentation (JSDocs)
- Ben: Helped with mob coding & made PoC for different aspects
- Evan: Helped with mob coding and researched testing framework (Jest)
- James: Helped with mob coding and researched code quality frameworks (Code Inspector)

# Use Story Pointing to measure tasks to implement

- Fully integrated build pipeline working
- Text entry mode also has date entry, tag selector
- Entries added to the IndexedDB
- Filtering by date/tag
- UI of the scrolling sidebar
- Scrolling sidebar backend working
- clicking tabs applies appropriate scrolling/filtering

# Assign tasks and agree on a reasonable goal to reach for this sprint
