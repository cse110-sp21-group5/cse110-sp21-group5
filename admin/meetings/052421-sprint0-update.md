# Team Status:
Nico:
- Finished feature, will work on actually adding tags in entry once Aasem finishes and integrates code into main

Aasem:
- Nearly done with feature, added indexDB functionality, making a few more design decisions with James & Ben, will finish it sometime this week

James:
- Worked with Aasem, feature is pretty much done but had a few questions regarding functionality, should be finished very soon

Ben:
- Finished adding lines functionality, nearly finished with showing different entries based on tab, going to work with Aasem on how to precisely merge their code

Jessi & Evan:
- Have a UI look figured out, decided to do a timeline rather than another scrollbar instead of the existing one we have. Just need to implement actual funcionality of it now, going to use the date functions built into JavaScript

Matthew:
- Added Github issues, was busy so couldn't do much in terms of coding this week but helped a lot with logistics and admin stuff
