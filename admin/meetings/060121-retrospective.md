# Sprint Retrospective

# What went well this sprint?
- Got a couple of features/branches merged. main branch has some fundamental functionality
- Accomplished most of the features we wanted to in their separate branch
- We used all of CI/CD pipeline except testing, learned and set precedent for it

# What could have gone better?
- Merging tabbing branch with database branch was time-consuming...more coordination before merge could make this easier
- Docs run on every branch with commits, requires extra work when merging pull requests, we could fix the automated doc creation to focus it only on changes
- Need to comment more to ensure everyone can keep up with ther code

# What will we try next instead?
- Coordinate with others before working or making assumptions to prevent merge difficulties
- Comment code often to make sure everyone is up to speed and understands what our portion is doing
- Aasem, Matthew or Nico will be in on every merge to get those repeating merge issues, figure it out the first time and repeat the fix

# What questions do we have?
- Next steps for integrating scroll bar?
  - Meet with Aasem and Nico since they are experienced with/making the database and know how data is stored
- Can we create a merge order? Yes...we will do it in the sprint planning

# Thank you everyone for your hard work this sprint!
