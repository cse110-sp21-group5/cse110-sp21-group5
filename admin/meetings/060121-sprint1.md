# Sprint Review

## What have we done this week

- Nico: Filtering with Aasem, reviewed code with Matthew and Evan, worked with Adam on character-delimited tagging
- Matthew: created 5 ADRs, peer reviewed code with Nico and James
- Jessi: Centered bullets on page for better visuals, added clouds background image, moved tabs, dates change color on hover, added shadow on menu bar and entries, resizing when window shrinks
- Aasem: Worked with Ben on tabs and Nico on filtering
- Ben: Worked with Aasem integrating IndexedDB to store bullets, worked out design decision on organizing data into folders by tag with Aasem, shared during stand up and sprint review meeting, 
- Evan: Reviewed filtering with with Matthew and Nico, Scroll Bar: highlights with scrolling, dropdown of days when we click a month, collapse when we click away, scrolls to date when we click the date
- James: Worked with Nico to integrate branch (code review), added custom/imporant flagging checkbox, migrated bullets to flex boxes to fixes entry overlapping bug

# Sprint Retrospective

# What went well this sprint?
- Got a couple of features/branches merged. main branch has some fundamental functionality
- Accomplished most of the features we wanted to in their separate branch
- We used all of CI/CD pipeline except testing, learned and set precedent for it

# What could have gone better?
- Merging tabbing branch with database branch was time-consuming...more coordination before merge could make this easier
- Docs run on every branch with commits, requires extra work when merging pull requests, we could fix the automated doc creation to focus it only on changes
- Need to comment more to ensure everyone can keep up with ther code

# What will we try next instead?
- Coordinate with others before working or making assumptions to prevent merge difficulties
- Comment code often to make sure everyone is up to speed and understands what our portion is doing
- Aasem, Matthew or Nico will be in on every merge to get those repeating merge issues, figure it out the first time and repeat the fix

# What questions do we have?
- Next steps for integrating scroll bar?
  - Meet with Aasem and Nico since they are experienced with/making the database and know how data is stored
- Can we create a merge order? Yes...we will do it in the sprint planning

# Thank you everyone for your hard work this sprint!

-----------------------------------
# Sprint Planning

# Sprint Goal
- Integrate our changes, merge our features to the main branch
- Have project complete by Monday
- Scrap things that we can't finish
- Bare Minimum 
  - Get tabs functioning
  - Finalize side bar
  - Everything merged
- Should:
  - Add different bullets for Note/Tasks/Events
- Make tests right away

# Review Roadmap

[Make alterations based on progress to the project.]

# Assign tasks and agree on a reasonable goal to reach for this sprint

[Walk through stories and decide what tasks need to be done, assign them reasonably, and then get verbal commitment from everyone in relation to their tasks.]
- Nico: Work with Ben to merge tabbing and filtering branches, merge those into main
- Matthew: Work on each of the merges as they trickle upwards, carrying knowledge from one, merge session to next, assign at least one unit test for each branch to the people working on the branches
- Jessi: Merge the scroll bar/styling branch with main
- Aasem: Work with Nico and Ben merging their branches into main as the IndexedDB expert, make ADR on IndexedDB Storage scheme (how and why we are organizing data/entries the way we are)
- Ben: Remove Recap tab, work with Nico to merge tabbing and filtering branches, merge those into main, then apply the filtering to the Custom tab
- Evan: Work with James to fit scroll bar within window in its entirety, Merge the side bar/styling branch with main
- James: Work with Evan to fix scroll bar so that it fits entirely in the window regardless of window size, sit in on side bar branch merge, add different bullet symbols for different tasks, Some kind of completion check box


# Clarify goal this week one last time before dismissing meeting, ensure everyone knows their tasks

# Consider Changes
- Keep the important tag showing
- [Scroll to nearest entry if we click on a date that has no bullets]

# TODO:
- ADR on why we get rid of RECAP
