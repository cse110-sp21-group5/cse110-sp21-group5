My name is Nico Tahernia, I'm a third-year Mathematics-Computer Science major. I'm one of the team leaders and also a full-stack engineer
and architect for the project. My previous work experience involves working at [Daybreak Game Company](https://www.daybreakgames.com/home) as an Automation Engineer Intern and [Perspecta](https://perspecta.com/) as an Innovation Intern. I'm an incoming Software Development
Engineer Intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) as well this summer in Seattle. My hobbies include a lot of sports both playing and watching (primarily soccer and tennis), music, reading, programming (lol), playing video games, and spending time with my girlfriend.
