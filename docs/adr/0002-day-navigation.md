# Navigating to a particular day

## Context and Problem Statement
How should the user navigate to a certain date in their bullet journal?


## Considered Options
* [Sidebar with months] - Clicking on a month will give you a drop down of the days. Clicking again will collapse it.
* [2 Sidebars] - One is for months and one is for days.
* [Filter based on numerical input] - Navigate based on numerical date entered.

## Decision Outcome

The decision outcome was the months sidebar. The option of 2 sidebars has the drawback of a cluttered UI, which goes against the idea of not overwhelming the user. Filtering based on numerical input is fast but, does not grant a sense of scale. Scale can be a helpful factor in terms of letting the user plan better. The months sidebar does have the negative consequence of having the day options being hidden, but it grants both scale and minimalism which lead to the decision outcome as this seems to be the most beneficial for the user.  

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* A minimal UI is achieved.

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* The day options is hidden. Depending on the user's background, this may be a problem.

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### [Sidebar with months]

* Good, because it gives the user a sense of where they are in time.
* Good, because it leads to a minimal UI that allows the user to focus on the current day until needing to navigate elsewhere.
* Bad, because the day options is hidden. User will need to figure that out.

### [2 Sidebars]

* Good, because both the months and days options are right in front of the user. The options aren't hidden.
* Bad, because it leads to a cluttered UI.


### [Filter based on numerical input]

* Good, because the user can quickly navigate to the exact numerical date they have in mind.  
* Bad, because there is no sense of scale of the user's journal. Doesn't give the user the sense of time.
