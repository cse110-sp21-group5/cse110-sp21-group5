# Removal of Recap Tab

* Deciders: Entire group. <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement

The recap tab seems redundant and unnecessary to implement based on the functionality of the daily journal and the sidebar implementation.

## Considered Options

* Keeping the recap page and making it the reverse of the daily log.
* Deleting the recap page entirely.
* Changing it to a different page.

## Decision Outcome

Chose option 2 because it seemed the best option given time constraints and goals of the web app.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Less work to spread resources to
* Less clutter on the site
* Easier interface to understand, don't have to explain more

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Loss of functionality so site might seem bland
* Makes navigation bar look emptier
