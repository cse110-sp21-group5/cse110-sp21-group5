Frame 1
"Upload: Can users be able to upload images or files that relate to their journal entry?"
"Set template or custom templates?"
"Filters to only look at bullets/notes/events?"

"Basic Elements of a BuJo Rapid logging: should be able to   record info down quickly What kinds of ""captures"" should we allow?Captures should be contextual: time, place, location, mood?  Bullets: mainly split into (a) Tasks (b) Notes (c) Events can mix/nest different types of bulletsallows for customization (if we choose to do so)bullet modifiers (emphasis/priority)  Index: the ""table of contents"" front of the journalgives pointers/leads to other parts of the journal (daily, monthly, other collections)shows volume of BuJo  Collection: pages should be grouped by a common theme most basic (required) ones are the collections by time: daily, monthly, future logfuture log should have the any monthly/yearly events planned/done (~6 months in advance)also need a custom log  Migration: Clean up unfinished tasks/events and move them rewriting and moving these tasks/events should make them more memorable and considered more often  "
"Accessibility   from https://venngage.com/blog/color-blind-friendly-palette/ Color combinations to avoid for people with color blindness include:     Red & green     Green & brown     Green & blue     Blue & gray     Blue & purple     Green & gray     Green & black   Patterns and textures can be used as well as colour coding StripesDotsGrid shapeSpiralsSomething fun? 90s Jazz solo cup pattern or somethingSearch '90s pattern' on GoogleThis could give our app a very unique flavourKeep it legible","https://venngage.com/blog/color-blind-friendly-palette/"
"This looks neat but the lines in the pattern are very thin and it's quite detailed, so it looks funny when sized down."
"This looks a lot better, especially when scaled down. Words are good and cool and there are going to be some here that say bujo things or whatever."
"Design decisions:"
"Common Themes Across Notes:"
"Initial Brainstorm"
"Nico"
"Matthew"
"Evan"
"Ben"
"Jessi"
"Aasem"
"James"
"Special patterns for each kind of note, helps with accessibility and also gives us a special flair to the webpage"
"small things: change color of webpage, different theme modes that don't change layout, only small things like colors"
"Overall simple design, allow a little customization: Fonts, images, but maintain the simplicity, smaller areas of personalization rather than complete overhaul"
"Customization: Multiple Layouts/Themes to choose from, user personalization, maybe stickers/emoji/audio logs/videos and images too?"
"Reminders"
"Easy to use interface (layout makes sense)"
"Colorblind friendly color palette (Accesibility)"
"Theme: Handwritten/pen & paper style"
"Different symbols/markers"
"Privacy options?"
"Backup function"
"Login (do we save the information locally or store it somewhere)"
"Ability to migrate from smaller-scope to larger-scope (day->month)"
"Different profiles?"
"Colour coding to categorise events/notes? (how to adapt for accessibility?)"
"some journal templates and fonts"
"Keyboard navigation (Accessibility)"
"Accessiblity: Color organization? Colorblind mode?"
"Allow for lots of contrast (black text on white background), colorblind color pallettes so we don't mix colors that clash, navigation options too"
"Bullet Journal Examples:"
"Keyboard shortcuts/ less reliance on mouse"
"User personlization: Fonts, Colors, Text-size, all within limits though"
"Single page? (No need to get lost in different tabs for a simple app)"
"<- Index may want to be a separate page: how do we want to format it?"
"Backup? Save entries in some sort of text. import/export"
"Quick entry - just type, then categorise as bullet/note/whatever afterwards"
"some stickers?"
"Privacy/storage: Do we store the data for each person's bullet journal locally or have a login system?"
"Both local and cloud storage: google drive, etc. First work with local, then go to cloud"
"Progress bar"
"Google drive/onedrive/etc integration for images?"
"classification and tags. Can sort by time, tags or subjects"
"Formatting: Bullets within bullets, organization through tabs"
"Simple text editor (a few fonts, sizes, etc.)"
"Index visualization of BuJo volume like pages in a book?"
"Organization: A way to index things and navigate through the journal, including a search feature"
"Tutorial/Instructions: How do the users figure out how to use the journal?"
"Super simple login...no email, just a username and maybe password"
"Allow going back to create new entries for skipped days"
"Audio log"
"Search function? (to find a particular bullet somewhere in the journal)"
"upload images and videos"
"Allow for filtering based on labels or category (task, event, etc.), add a selection bar at the top to filter by certain topic"
"Simple organization, have a sidebar to allow for searching months, allows you to easily jump to the part of the page where a certain month is"
"calendar?"
"Speed and simplicity: an interface that allows you to work fast without getting lost and looks good"
"Do we allow users the option to rearrange the journal or have defined text boxes?"
"Index that updates automatically based on entries"
"Visual customisation - 2/3/4 themes that change interface fonts/bullet styles, obligatory dark mode"
"make a word limit to every bullet"
"Want to maintain a simple design so users don't get lost and it doesn't lose the purpose of what it's supposed to be in the end: bullet journal"
"Backup: Ability to backup files and the journal somewhere (Maybe a download feature where you can download a backup version)?"
"Potential Inspiration: https://www.elisiapp.com/home","https://www.elisiapp.com/home"
"start entry on current day automatically"
"Integrate stuff from Google/other calendar to drop into future log? Push future log out to calendar?"
"Allow for export if the person chooses, different formats such as docx, pdf, but also have google drive integration later so it can just backup to the google drive"
"Limitation on size of bullets: character limit?"
"Limitation on bullet ""title"", can add a description if necessary if they really want to elaborate on something"
"sync calendar events/reminders"
"Collapsing days into weeks into months like a calendar?"
"Case Study 2: What I like: Simple colors, sparse layout, not too many controls. Very zen and straightforwardCheckbox let's you complete task and there is a list of things you've completed that you can open if you want to see it. This can help to feel good at the end of a day to see how much you accomplished.  What could be improved: for our page, I still like the idea of a single scrolling page with a list of links in a gutter on the side to navigate to months"
"Case Study 1: What I like: Single page  What could be improved: No popup tiles... this adds to the clutterThe layout in general seems cluttered, I would rather have a long page that you have to scroll through with a navigation bar on the side to get quickly to what month you want to see (think iPhone contacts list) instead of doing the tiles and trying  to fit it all on the screen at once.Not a fan of images in the background/layout either. They can be distracting. How about something simple just like a notebook would be, lined paper."
"Remind users of a certain day based on weather - April 15 vs ""that one really hot/cold/rainy day"""
"""Description"" can include other larger forms of information as well (pictures, video, audio)"
"Local storage? If we integrate with existing cloud storage platforms, gives confidence against intrusion or deletion"
"use a unique set of patterns as well as colour coding - 90s patterns etc could give us a unique look"
"Clicking on a month will drop down the days; Clicking again would collapse the days (James)"
"Filter by: Date (Default)"
"Maybe have the numbers shown just like the months? Side by side? -Evan"
